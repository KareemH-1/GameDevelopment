## About

This project was initially based on a Pong game tutorial. However, I have expanded upon the original tutorial by adding several features and improvements of my own.

### Original Tutorial

[How to make a 3D game with Unity in 1 hour | Beginner Tutorial | Easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3xgCUlst88)
All the core assets (e.g., sprites, original scripts) are from the tutorial.

### My Contributions

* **Increased Difficulty:** The ball speed increases over time, making the game more challenging as the player progresses.
* **Menu and Pause Music:** Added background music that switches between menu and gameplay, enhancing the game's atmosphere.
* **Main Menu Functionality:** Implemented a functional main menu to select game modes.
* **Pause Menu:** Added a pause menu to allow players to pause and resume the game.
* **Visuals:** Changed visuals , lighting and fog , added more sound effects.
* **Player Vs. Ai** Implemented Player Vs. AI as it was not used in the video (only the logic of ai was written)
